# 2D_flow_profile_solver

2D_flow_profile_solver is a 2D finite element solver to simulate fully developed laminar flow through arbitrarily shaped microchannels. The solver takes an image of the inlet boundary geometry and a flow rate ratio of the inner and outer flow as inputs, creating the velocity profile of the fully developed laminar low as output.
